        As I was sitting at my local watering hole with a few friends watching the World Cup’s Japan v. Denmark game,
        the discussion quickly turned to the upcoming knock out game between the U.S. and Ghana. Being that we were all
        of Ethiopian descent, the fanfare was leaning towards Ghana, the only remaining African team. Except for me that
        was, as I was a little conflicted, being that the U.S. is now my home and I have no ties to Ghana, other than the
        fact that we share a continent. No shocker as to where my friends were leaning, except for the vehemency in which
        they were rooting for the U.S. team’s demise. They were quite adamant in wanting the U.S. to fail. This struck a
        chord with me.

        Why are so many refugees at odds with their now resident nation? Why do we so often take pleasure in the failure of
        this country that has taken us in with such open arms? Don’t get me wrong… I’m not so naive that I see no fault in
        the U.S. and their dealings with foreign policy. I find the U.S. conflicts in the Middle East quite abhorrent and
        despise their indifference to the atrocities in Africa and other regions of the world, where the U.S. has no vested
        interest. But I still CHOOSE to remain here. Just as I CHOSE to move to the U.S. from my native Ethiopia in the mid
        90’s. I chose to come here, because I felt I would have a better life here. And this still remains true. I am not
        arguing that life is better here for everyone, rather than their native lands… but it’s true for me and my family.
        So I continue to remain here. In a few years, I would have been a resident of the U.S. for a larger portion of my
        life than my native land. I still view myself as an Ethiopian first and will continue to do so for the remainder of
        my days, but I do feel a certain level of allegiance to these here United States. This is where I’ve got my education
        and earn my living. This is where I see myself living out my days and raising my family. Happily. Is it so wrong to
        feel a sense of loyalty to my new home?
